This repo contains the supporting documentation and files for a simple shiny app developed for the Cousera Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization. The app is based on a data set obtained and described here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG. The app itself takes allows the user to input specifics about their vehicle and obtain an estimated MPG based on a GLM prediction algorithm generated from the original data set. Users can pick their vehicle attributes. Once they hit submit, the app returns their vehicles predicted MPG. This repo contains the following additional files:

ui.R used to generate the shiny app
server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
The Project.md is the Markdown file that generates the R Presenter presentation describing the shiny app
The Project.html is a HTML compiled from the .md file, and generates the presentation hosted on RPubs here: http://rpubs.com/eddiebeherano/courseproject.
